If the brand doesn't resonate with people, it follows that metrics won't converge the way you'd like. Likewise, if you optimize the brand for a specific market, you could easily alienate others. To art direct Google Travel, I had to dig deep into my skillset. I created a data-viz encompassing all (thousands) Google's branded marks to distill common visual language principles. The analysis added a quantitative emphasis on the largely subjective visual design giving senior stakeholders a common language to offer feedback around. Landing this brand has been one of my favorite experience at Google since it brought together equal parts strategy and human-centered asthetics.",

Together, a fellowship of five Googlers and I recognized a gap in the principles and processes by which AI-powered features were being conceived and developed. Over the course of a year, we synthesized data and insights from internal product teams, industry experts, and academic research. From our insights, we crafted the People + AI Guidebook, an open source resource advocating for a more human-centered approach to AI.",

Fiercely advocating for even stronger human sensibility and values within machine intelligence has stretched and deepened my own design philosophy. Working alongside passionate teammates filled me with bottomless energy and I loved the process of distilling opaque academic theory into concrete and actionable recommendations."

Traditionally, Connectomics is a tedious and time consuming process performed by manually tracing through a volume of micrographs like a 3D coloring book. To glean meaningful information from biological neural networks, many thousands of neurons must be reconstructed. Researchers at SeungLab specialize in volumetric neuron reconstruction and employ sophisticated Machine Learning + Computer Vision techniques in collaboration with expert tracers to rapidly accelerate this process.",
                "challenge": "To catalogue the complexity of the human brain, researchers at Seunglab are working towards an automated pipeline for gathering and processing experimental data. However, neuroscience has a data problem and Seunglab is no exception. Researchers have an excess of data and a lack of investigative power. The scale of today’s scientific challenges demand cross–disciplinary collaboration. Collaboration presents an opportunity for teams to leverage each others specialties to move faster and tackle larger and more important problems. Collaboration necessitates sharing of knowledge, time, ideas, skills, and increasingly data. How can researchers at Seunglab benefit from collaboration?"

Not every proposed feature made it to the current release but an extensive styleguide and robust development framework allow for extendability by a skeleton team of ressearchers at SeungLab.",

To this day I am in awe of his delivery, pacing, and the way he weaved together just the right metaphors to convey his message in a memorable way. I never could have imagined that years later, I’d be collaborating with him directly, at MIT Media Lab.",

In Virtual Reality, visitors were able to teleport into a foreign yet familiar world to explore a new pathway of narrative - the electrophysical connections among neurons. They ventured into a freshly discovered circuit of cells responsible in part for the brain’s ability to perceive motion - the very ebb and flow of story itself.",

Fiercely advocating for even stronger human sensibility and values within machine intelligence has stretched and deepened my own design philosophy. Working alongside passionate teammates filled me with bottomless energy and I loved the process of distilling opaque academic theory into concrete and actionable recommendations."

Anyone can play and you need no scientific background—over 200,000 people from 145 countries already do. Together they are mapping the 3D structure of neurons; advancing the quest to understand ourselves. To achieve viral and sustained growth, Eyewire will need to invest in improved user experience design. UX design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction and loyalty by improving the usability, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product.",

Shrugging aside current browser limitations, I set to work designing and prototyping my vision for the future of Eyewire.

It also complimented the dark-UI, shifting the users focus to the 3D neuron."

I then quickly worked alongside game admins and our game dev team to generate rough specifications for an MVP notification system. After a lot of initial sketching I moved to building out a solid file structure in preparation for an iterative design cycle between static assets in Sketch and the dynamic world of Framer. The Synapse prototype has been my first experience heavily integrating Framer into my design process. Though Framer has a significantly higher learning curve than something like Invision or Flinto, the potential is incredible. Having a strong foundation in programing, I find that Framer simplifies the development cycle for a number of common interaction design challenges like tuning microinteractions, designing with real data, and testing application behavior + feedback loops. Framer integrates super well with Sketch symbols speeding the refinement process for design language towards a sort of parametric system like many CAD software packages (Solid Works, 3ds Max, etc). I'm looking forward to working more with Framer.",

We were invited to this White House Frontiers conference to present our latest virtual reality experience: MSTY. The three pound organ sitting behind y our eyes is nothing short of extraordinary. Symphonic activity among billions of neurons gives rise to thoughts, feelings, and ultimately, the perspective and personality that turn a brain into a mind. Thanks to cutting edge AI, nanoscale resolution imaging, and the help of a quarter million gamers from around the world, crowdsources neuroscience sets the pace for a new wave of discovery. The creators of Eyewire reveal the first glimpse of Neo a cortical game coming 2017 that will invite gamers to solve the puzzles of perception.",
                "challenge": "MSTY VR is our most recent virtual reality experience. It features a knotty entanglement of neuron reconstructions from cortex—the outer most layer of brain tissue responsible for perception. MSTY, so named for the particular flavor of AI involved in the reconstruction process, was intended to be a mostly passive safari-type experience. The user would be accompanied by a friendly, derpy, but exceedingly capable AI companion—MSTY. Inspired by Google's early ImageNet dataset and success in training neural networks to recognize cats in Youtube videos, we conceived MSTY as a hovering cat–like robot with paw–like arms. The experience lasted approximately 5 minutes, during which MSTY intelligently and naturally navigates toward areas of interest acting as a sort of subliminal tour guide."

Anyone can play and you need no scientific background—over 200,000 people from 145 countries already do. Together they are mapping the 3D structure of neurons; advancing the quest to understand ourselves. To achieve viral and sustained growth, Eyewire will need to invest in improved user experience design. UX design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction and loyalty by improving the usability, ease of use, and pleasure provided in the interaction between the user and the product.",
                "challenge": "I challenged my team to design a mobile friendly solution for connecting prospective Eyewire players to the science and the story behind the citizen science project. Better UX through interative narrative will result in increased conversion and retension rates. I proposed a refresh to Eyewire’s current landing page and the addition of an explore section featuring complete support for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The increased context will allow prospective players to engage with Eyewire before entering the tutorial leading to substaintially increased conversion rates."

I worked primarily with Processing for prototyping and its Js cousin p5 for the final implementation. Early prototyping with Processing was swift and revealed lots of possible visual and behaviorial directions for the simulations. I learned a lot of hard lessons converting my native Processing code to work in the browser. Performance considerations across devices and inconsistencies across browswers lead to many hours of perfomance tuning and code reviews with our devlopers to help make the vision a reality."

This citizen science human-based computation game challenges players to map 3D neurons in a retina. Eyewire was officially launched on December 10, 2012 and has since grown to over 200,000 players from 150 countries. Eyewire gameplay advances neuroscience by helping researchers discover how neurons connect to process visual information. Anyone, anywhere can help neuroscientists develop advanced artificial intelligence and computational technologies for mapping the connectome. In Eyewire, gamers solve 3D puzzles. As they solve the puzzles, they are actually reconstructing 3D models of neurons at nanoscale resolution from electron microscopy images. Eyewire requires no scientific background to play and works best on high speed internet.",

Based on the nature of the game and a potential throwback to pychedelic rock anthem, we framed the challenge as a 'Journey into the depths of the retina'. The formal language was inspired by digital aspects of the neuron reconstruction, while the asset behavior was inspired by the computational processes of active neurons and cellular automata. The wordmark is composed of sixteen individual squares relating to the sixteen sectors of the scientific endeavor."

Inspired by Neri Oxman's + Meejin Yoon's 'Design Across Scales' MIT Media Lab course, and naturally, Charles and Ray Eames’ canonical Powers of Ten, DAS explores the relationship between science and engineering through the lens of Design. It examines how transformations in science and technology have influenced design thinking, and vice versa. It explores interdisciplinary tools and methods to represent, model, design and fabricate objects, machines, and systems. DAS is organized by scale, topics ranging from the macro to micro are investigated across multiple problem contexts to demonstrate that design is not a discipline, but a way of looking at the world; one that promotes the synthesis of interdisciplinary knowledge across scales in order to create objects and systems for the greater good.",

Design the layout system, develop the brand and identity system, and assemble all of the content. And make it affordable—make it monochromatic. Can you design something people will actually want—imagine a journal for creative frontiers, a journal for the anti-discpliplinary, a journal for design across scales and problem contexts."

                "brief": "MuWu is a collection of the thoughts and the experience of John Cage. Inspired by the classic text, I Ching, MuWu is intended to ask questions. How is a book composed? What is language and how does it flow? After a single trip to China, John Cage was converted to a Taoist believer. He incorporated chance operations, found in the I Ching, into most of his artworks for the rest of his life. Letting go of intention and embracing the natural flow of tao led Cage to create some of the 20th century's most influential artworks. MuWu pays homaged to to late John Cage by continuing where he left off. The book uses a computational approach to to story telling to fill up exactly 64 body pages with unique content from the compilation, Conversing with Cage. The length was chosen in response to the 64 hexagrams of the I Ching. MuWu attempts to assemble completely new and unique thoughts from the any dialogues found in Conversing with Cage. This approach shifts creative control from the designer towards the algorithm.",
                "challenge": "MuWu was concieved as a student project during my junior year of university. At the time, I was still quite new to programing and just getting my feet wet with the possibilities of design mediated computation. It was a serious risk to take on a full book publication using an unfamiliar technology and ambitious concept. Through the patience of my professors, many, many late evenings debugging, researching, and most importantly a marked propensity for experimentation MuWu came into existance. The final deliverable consisted of a set of eight hand-printed and hard-cover, hand-bound books of exceptional quality. When you leaf through MuWu, you feel none of the struggle, only a clear and simple concept and formal delivery."

It is very curious that this is nearly the same meaning as the Greek letter 'μ' pronounced 'mu' which in modern academia is reference to a very small measurement. The title is appropriate as this text seeks to distance the design from the final outcome. Both the content and layout of the MuWu are algorithmically sampled. MuWu was sort of my introduction to the possibilities of generative design."

The Our Epigenomes collection stems from a culmination of life experience. Although we are very close as identical twins and share much of the same genome, my sister and I couldn't be more unique. A lifetime of differing experiences has caused certain traits to develop, uniquely conditioning each of us to our respective environments. Epigenomes are trait differences not caused by DNA, epigenetic modification is occurs slowly, over a lifetime due to these differing experiences.",

The form of the project was a two-week exchange of Japanese and American students—the aim of the project was to promote cultural exchange and foster international collaboration. Although the exchange lasted only two-weeks, we spent months preparing, learning about the history, cultral norms, and common language-isms. The two-weeks spent traveling Japan have been some of the most moving and transformative of my life.",
                "challenge": "We were asked to design simple greeting-cards. The cards should include our name, discipline, and some form of contact information—the rest was up to us. At the time, I was taking traditional graphic design classes at MassArt while exploring the possibilities of design mediated computation at MIT. Most business cards are flat, and strictly information delivery vehicles—at best a business card could be memorable, maybe even novel. What if a business card were multi-dimensional? What if it invited interaction? Could a business card help to overcome a language barrier? I gave myself a single weekend to design, prototype, and fabricate 250 cards. This is the result. "

                "brief": "Jenga Unchained was concieved during to Neri Oxman's 'Design Across Scales' course at MIT Media Lab. The prompt was simple, create a response that embodies 'The design of play.'' Instead of trying to invent a new game from scratch we explored classic game design concepts by totally reversing the rules. If the game was played in 2D, how would it feel in 3D? If the game was about destruction, how would it feel being constructed? After loads of playful conversations and paper prototyes, we settled on a concept for a game that could be played either competitively or collaboratively. We called this game Jenga Unchained.",
                "challenge": "I worked on an interdiscplinary team including two architects and an economist. I found it super interesting learning about the motivations of my fellow teammates. Each of us had a different notion of the concept of play, so initial brainstorms were all over the place. What immediately felt like a hinderance led us to a successful melding of minds. The architects pushed for 3D forms with haptics, the economist wanted a system that could be exploited for value, and I was intrigued by the possibility given by modularity. The final game felt like the combination of our unique ideas.",
